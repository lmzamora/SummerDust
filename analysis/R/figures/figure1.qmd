## Figure 1

This figure shows, over sea ice, (a) The likelihood of Arctic clouds at different altitudes being classified by CloudSat as either liquid, mixed, or ice phase. (b) The estimated dust-driven increases in cloud glaciation in different meteorological conditions. (c) The meteorological and aerosol parameters that best predict how glaciation changes within meteorological bins, based on deviance explained in a generalized additive model.

## Running Code

For **Figure 1** you first load the following libraries:

```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
library(colorBlindness)
```

For **Figure 1a** you then load the following datasets:

```{r}
#| echo: false
load("../../data/derived_data/fCliq.RData")
load("../../data/derived_data/fCmpc.RData")
load("../../data/derived_data/fCice.RData")
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
