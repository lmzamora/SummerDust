## Figure 2

This figure shows properties over summertime sea ice of single-layer clouds at least partially overlapping with 2.5-3.5 km elevation, from May to September. a, b) Estimated average cooling from cloud changes due to dust aerosols (at BOA and TOA, respectively). Error bars show the vales at the low- and high-end FLEXPART background dust threshold. c) The average FLEXPART and MERRA-2 dust concentrations associated with the clouds. d) Average % of time that the clouds were at temperatures below -10 Â°C. e) The average solar zenith angle for the clouds at the time of measurement.
